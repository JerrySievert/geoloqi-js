Geoloqi Javascript Library for Node.js (and eventually Web Browsers)
===
Powerful, flexible, lightweight interface to the Geoloqi platform API, written in JavaScript!

This library was developed with two goals in mind: to be as simple as possible, but also to be very powerful to allow for much higher-end development (multiple Geoloqi apps per instance, concurrency, performance).

There is a browser-side version in the works, but for now we have a Node.js Session interface available.

Installation
---

    npm install geoloqi

Basic Usage
---
Geoloqi uses OAuth2 for authentication, but if you're only working with your own account, you don't need to go through the authorization steps! Simply go to your account settings on the [Geoloqi site](http://geoloqi.com), click on "Connections" and copy the OAuth 2 Access Token. You can use this token to run the following examples.

In Node.js:

    var geoloqi = require('geoloqi'),
        session = new Session({'access_token':'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN'});
    
    session.get('/account/username', function(result, err) {
      if(err) {
        throw new Error('There has been an error! '+err);
      } else {
        console.log(result.username);
      }
    }

For a post:

    var geoloqi = require('geoloqi'),
        session = new Session({'access_token':'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN'});

    session.post('/account/profile', {'name':'Baron Ãœnderbheit'}, function(result, err) {
      if(err) {
        throw new Error('There has been an error! '+err);
      } else {
        console.log(result);
      }
    }
